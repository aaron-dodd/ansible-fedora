# Android applications and a setup guide

I prefer to use [obtainium] and [aurora store] to manage apps on android. Both
of these can be managed using [obtainium] so that should be the first app I get
on a brand new device. In general I try to grab apps from their official source
where possible, but I will often default to:

1. Obtainium
2. Aurora store
3. Google Play store

Play store doesn't seem to update applications very often, in my experience
it's been difficult to know if apps are up to date and where to go to update
them on the google play store if you accidentally dismiss the "Apps have
updates" notification by accident. In contrast [obtainium] and [aurora store]
are much better about this.
